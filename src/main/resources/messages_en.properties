landingPage.aboutspeakerly=Speaker.ly allows you to have conversations with real people in other languages, so you can practice while you're learning. We love all the great ways there are to learn langauages: classes, tutors, books, Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, LiveMocha, etc. These and other methods can be great, but most of language-learning methods are missing one thing: Live Conversation! This is why we made Speaker.ly. With Speaker.ly, you can search for someone to speak with and immediately beign a conversation with them.

faq.whatdoestheotherpersongetoutofit=When Speaker.ly is ready for everyone, we will have implemented a credit system. When someone has a conversation in their native language, they will receive credits. They can then use these credits to have a conversation in a language they want to practice! So don't just use Speaker.ly for practicing langauges, use it to help others practice, too!
